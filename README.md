# Programming UFMG

Storing (almost) all code and projects I had to make during my graduation in UFMG.

## Moved to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/lucaspellegrinelli-ufmg)

This project was moved into my gitlab due to the improved project organisation offered by gitlab. Before this was a monorepo with everything, which was really incovenient. Now it is divided into pretty little folders.
